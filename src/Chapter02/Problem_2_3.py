Problem 2.3 â€” Correctness of Horner's Scheme

Horner's method evaluates a polynomial:
P(x) = a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2 + ... + an*x^n
in O(n) time using a nested multiplication approach.

Algorithm:
- Start from the highest degree coefficient and iterate downwards.
- At each step, multiply the current result by x and add the next coefficient.
