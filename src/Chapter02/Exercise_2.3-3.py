Exercise 2.3-3 (CLRS) â€” Inductive proof of recurrence solution

Task:
Prove, using mathematical induction, that for n being an exact power of two,
the recurrence
    T(n) = 2, if n = 2
    T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n, if n = 2^k for k > 1
has the solution T(n) = n * lg(n).

This script provides a computational check for small powers of two.
