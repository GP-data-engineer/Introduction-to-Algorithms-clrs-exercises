Exercise 2.3-1 (CLRS) â€” Illustrating merge sort

Task:
Illustrate (similar to Figure 2.4 in the book) the operation of the merge sort
algorithm for the array A = (3, 41, 52, 26, 38, 57, 9, 49).

Requirements:
- Show the recursive division of the array into subarrays.
- Show the merging steps until the array is sorted.
- Output should clearly indicate each merge step.

Note:
This is primarily a tracing/illustration exercise, not an optimization task.
