"""
Problem 2.2 (CLRS) â€” Correctness of Bubble Sort

Task:
Implement the BUBBLESORT procedure as described in the pseudocode.
Prove its correctness using loop invariants.

Algorithm:
- Repeatedly swap adjacent elements if they are out of order.
- After the i-th pass, the i largest elements are in their correct positions at the end of the array.

Time complexity:
- Worst case: O(n^2)
- Best case: O(n) if optimized with a swapped flag (not implemented here).
